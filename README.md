# dket: Deep Knowledge Extraction from Text
The DKET project has the goal to devise a Neural Networks based Ontology Learning system that doesn't rely on hand-crafted rules and it is trained in an end-to-end fashion. The motivation and some preliminary investigation and results can be found in this [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_31).
